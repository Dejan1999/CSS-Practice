# Day 2 – CSS Box-Sizing Practice

This folder contains a basic example for exploring the `box-sizing` property in CSS.

## What was done

- Created a simple HTML structure (`div.hero-overview`) with heading
- Applied basic styles using external CSS:
  - Removed default body margin
  - Added padding, border, and margin to `.hero-overview`
  - Introduced `box-sizing: border-box` to control element dimensions
  
## What's next

I'm continuing to learn about the `box-sizing` property, how it affects layout, and how it combines with width, padding, and border. This is just the beginning of the layout model practice.

✅ I will keep updating this as I go through more layout-related topics like:
- Content-box vs border-box
- Width/height calculations
- Box model visualization

Stay tuned for more daily progress.
