# CSS Practice

This repository contains my daily CSS practice exercises.  
I am learning and applying various CSS concepts including:

- Selectors and specificity
- Box model (box-sizing, margin, padding, border)
- Display property (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`)
- Layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive design
- Typography and colors
- Animations and transitions

---

## ✅ Day 1 – CSS Selectors and Specificity

Practiced different CSS selector types and specificity hierarchy:

- Element, Class, ID, Universal, Attribute selectors
- Specificity levels and overriding styles
- Applied multiple selectors to a paragraph to test priority

## ✅ Day 2 – Box-Sizing and Display Property

Focused on two core layout concepts: box-sizing and display.

### 🧱 Box-Sizing

- Practiced `content-box` and `border-box` models
- Applied width, padding, and border to visualize layout behavior
- Compared how total width is calculated under different box models

### 🎯 Display Property

- Used `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`, and `visibility: hidden`
- Demonstrated layout behavior of each display type
- Tested margin and width/height interaction for inline/inline-block

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- Add layout sections to the main site (`hero`, `about`, `courses`, etc.)
- Practice responsive layout with `Flexbox` and `Grid`
- Move into `Tailwind CSS` once core CSS is strong
- Then: JavaScript → React → Full Stack 🔥

## ✅ Day 3 – Flexbox Basics Practice

Focused on Flexbox container and item properties.

### 🧩 Flexbox Container Properties
- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction`
- `flex-wrap`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `flex-flow` shorthand

### 🎯 Flexbox Item Properties
- `flex-basis`
- `flex-grow`
- `order`
- `flex` shorthand for grow, shrink, basis

Created a simple layout with three boxes practicing direction, wrapping, alignment, and sizing.
