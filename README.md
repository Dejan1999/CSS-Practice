# CSS Practice

This repository contains my daily CSS practice exercises.  
I am learning and applying various CSS concepts including:

- Selectors and specificity
- Box model (box-sizing, margin, padding, border)
- Display property (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`)
- Layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive design
- Typography and colors
- Animations and transitions

## ✅ Day 1 – CSS Selectors and Specificity

Practiced different CSS selector types and specificity hierarchy:

- Element, Class, ID, Universal, Attribute selectors
- Specificity levels and overriding styles
- Applied multiple selectors to a paragraph to test priority

## ✅ Day 2 – Box-Sizing and Display Property

Focused on two core layout concepts: box-sizing and display.

### 🧱 Box-Sizing

- Practiced `content-box` and `border-box` models
- Applied width, padding, and border to visualize layout behavior
- Compared how total width is calculated under different box models

### 🎯 Display Property

- Used `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`, and `visibility: hidden`
- Demonstrated layout behavior of each display type
- Tested margin and width/height interaction for inline/inline-block

## ✅ Day 3 – Flexbox Basics Practice

Focused on Flexbox container and item properties.

### 🧩 Flexbox Container Properties
- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction`
- `flex-wrap`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `flex-flow` shorthand

### 🎯 Flexbox Item Properties
- `flex-basis`
- `flex-grow`

- `flex` shorthand for grow, shrink, basis

Created simple layouts with flex containers and practiced direction, wrapping, alignment, and sizing.

## ✅ Day 4 – CSS Grid Basics Practice

Focused on CSS Grid container and item behavior.

### 📐 Grid Container Properties
- `display: grid`
- `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` for defining grid structure
- `gap` for controlling spacing between grid items
- `grid-auto-rows` for implicit row sizing

### 🎯 Grid Item Properties
- Used `nth-child()` selector for alternate styling
- Controlled grid item positioning with `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end`
- Practiced spanning grid columns and making responsive layouts with `auto-fit` and `minmax()`

## 📚 Courses Page

The **Courses** page showcases three levels of our web development program:

- ✅ Basic (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - ES6)
- ✅ Intermediate (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - ES5 & ES6)
- ✅ Advanced (HTML5, CSS3 with SASS/SCSS, JavaScript with OOP)

Each course is presented in its own styled container with a short description and custom layout. The design emphasizes structure using:

- `Flexbox` for layout alignment and ordering
- `Positioning` and `Z-index` for layered effects (e.g. "Recommended" badge)
- Custom fonts (`Source Code Pro` and `Courier Prime`)
- Responsive-friendly sizing (`min-width`, `min-height`)
- Hover effects and transitions

### 🎨 Tools & Skills Used

- HTML5 & CSS3
